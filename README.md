The Speaker Detection project aims to identify speakers from audio recordings using a deep learning model. This application utilizes a user-friendly graphical interface to allow users to select an audio file from their system and receive a prediction about the speaker's identity. The project involves training a deep learning model to classify speakers and uses TensorFlow for the model and Tkinter for the graphical user interface.
